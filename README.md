## 📌 CPP01 - Memory Allocation & Pointers
This module covers **dynamic memory management, references, and constructors/destructors**.

### 🛠 Topics Covered:
- Pointers and references
- Stack vs. Heap memory
- new and delete for memory allocation
- Class constructors & destructors

### 🚀 Completed Exercises:
1. **Exercise 00** - Basics of pointers and references.
2. **Exercise 01** - Dynamic memory allocation using new and delete.
3. **Exercise 02** - Implementing a simple class with a constructor and destructor.

## 📌 CPP02 - OOP & Orthodox canonical form
This module introduces **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts like **Orthodox canonical form**.

### 🛠 Topics Covered:
- Access modifiers: public, private
- Function overloading
- Operator overloading
- Orthodox Canonical Form

---

## 📌 CPP03 - Inheritance
This module introduces **class inheritance** in C++.

### 🛠 Topics Covered:
- Base and Derived classes
- Inheritance types: public, protected, private
- Constructors and destructors in inheritance
- Virtual functions and method overriding

---

## 📌 CPP04 - Subtype Polymorphism & Abstract Classes
This module introduces **subtype polymorphism, abstract classes**.

### 🛠 Topics Covered:
- Abstract base classes
- Pure virtual functions
- Polymorphism in object-oriented design

## ⚠️ Notes:
- These exercises follow the **C++98 standard**.
- No external libraries are allowed.
- **Memory leaks must be avoided** (use valgrind for testing).
